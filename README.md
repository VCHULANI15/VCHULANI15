# Who Am I?
> Global Nomad. Mumbai - Dubai - Indianapolis - London - New York City.

> Present: Graduate Business Analytics student at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University in Durham, NC.

I am a Senior student majoring in Finance and Quantitative Economics (Honors) at the Kelley School of Business IUPUI with an undergraduate certificate in Fundamentals of Data Analytics. I am currently seeking an entry-level role in the field of Finance, Economics, or Data Analytics as these will enable me to invest my skills, experiences, and knowledge in a reputed company, and passionately build a long-term career. 

As an international student, I had the opportunity to collaborate with multi-faceted individuals from different backgrounds and specializations over key projects, and this has enhanced my leadership qualities, sharpened my communication skills, and helped me to create valued connections. Being a mentor has allowed me to connect and guide others while consistently striving to deliver better results. 

I am a highly motivated individual who thrives on challenges. I believe in focused goals and productive life. My intellectual curiosity drives me to be a learner, willing to go the extra mile to deliver and exceed expectations where possible.
